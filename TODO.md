# Minimal LLM Language - Progress and TODO

## âœ… Completed

1. Parser Improvements
   - Implemented proper operator precedence hierarchy
     - `parse_expression` for low precedence (+, -, =)
     - `parse_term` for high precedence (*, /)
     - `parse_factor` for atomic expressions and parentheses
   - Fixed nested expression handling
   - Added detailed error messages with line numbers and suggestions
   - Improved error context with surrounding code display
   - Added helpful suggestions for common syntax errors
   - Implemented proper handling of symbolic keywords and operators
   - Added support for all language-specific Unicode symbols including:
     * Core symbols (Î», Æ’, Î¹, âŸ¼, âŒ½)
     * Library symbols (âˆ‡, âŒ¸, âš¿, âš , âŸ‘)
     * Greek letters for variables (Î±-Ï‰)
     * Mathematical symbols (âˆ…, âˆ‘, âˆ€, Ï€)
     * UI symbols (â¬¢, â–¡, â¬š, âœŽ, âŒ¨)
     * Network symbols (âš¡, âŠ², â‡‰)
     * Concurrency symbols (âŸ¿, â‡¢, â‡ , âŸ°)
     * File operations (â†¯, â†±)
     * Security symbols (ðŸ”’, ðŸ”‘, #)

2. Core Language Features
   - Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
   - String operations (concatenation, equality)
   - Collection operations (empty, add, sum)
   - Error handling (try-catch with `Ã·`)
   - Nested expressions with proper precedence
   - Method calls with library prefixes
   - String literals and proper token position tracking
   - Boolean literals using `âŠ¤` and `âŠ¥` symbols
   - Variable declarations with `Î¹`
   - Function declarations with `Æ’`
   - Library declarations with `Î»`
   - Return statements with `âŸ¼`
   - Print statements with `âŒ½`

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - Comprehensive lexer tests
   - Parser unit tests for all language constructs
   - Integration tests for core functionality
   - Test cases for error handling
   - Dedicated test suite for syntax errors
   - Concurrency and channel tests
   - Shared state tests
   - Network operation tests

4. Semantic Analysis
   - Type system with Number, String, Collection, Boolean types
   - Type inference for expressions and operations
   - Variable scope validation with nested scopes
   - Function parameter and return type validation
   - Collection type validation
   - Comprehensive type checking tests
   - Error handling with proper stack traces
   - Source location tracking in errors
