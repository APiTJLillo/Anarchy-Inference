# Anarchy Inference: Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive assessment of risks associated with the Anarchy Inference project and outlines strategic mitigation approaches for each identified risk. The purpose is to demonstrate to potential funders that we have thoroughly considered potential challenges and have developed practical strategies to address them. This risk assessment covers technical, adoption, financial, competitive, and operational dimensions of the project.

## 1. Technical Risks
