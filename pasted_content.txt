Minimal Token Coding


ABOUT ME

My name is Terry Lillo, and I’m a father of two and a dog. My passion for technology started around the age of 8 when I disassembled my mother’s laptop, brought it for show-and-tell at school, and found out I was not able to put it back together in front of my class. Since that age, I’ve always been mostly self-taught by understanding how things work internally before learning how to work with them externally. I progressed from there into a little bit of gaming, well game hacking actually, one of my passions has always been to make a thing work in a way that it wasn’t designed to work. I never really enjoyed gaming as much as I enjoyed automation and manipulation of games. That lead me into web development, mobile app development, desktop development, learning REST API integrations, and ultimately where I’m at now as a ServiceNow developer. I’ve been at my current company since 2012. I started there in the field as a pipeline laborer, worked my way into an IT helpdesk role, where I showed my skills in automation and development to work my way into a Technology and Innovation Engineer role. From there, I found this ServiceNow role as an opportunity to grow in our(then) parent company, and now I work for that parent company(APi Group Inc.) doing automation for 50+ companies in the US and globally.


KNOWLEDGE SHARING

A view that I strongly align myself with is the open exchange of ideas and knowledge sharing. I bundled these into one, because they synergize well and I feel that one cannot live without the other. Open exchange of ideas, open mindedness, and open source are all areas that require willingness to consider the viewpoints and creativity of others. Knowledge sharing is a passion of mine, and it closely relates to those same three areas. I feel there are people who are willing to share knowledge and some who hoard knowledge, and it’s important to me that I share my knowledge to help others move forward in a positive direction.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Minimal LLM Language is a revolutionary programming language crafted for AI-generated code. It is created by AI, for AI, and not for humans to need to understand. Featuring single-byte encoding, mathematical symbols for logic, and built-in compression, it is optimized for deep LLM comprehension and token efficiency. Our goal is to dramatically reduce inference costs through small, specialized local models—while fine-tuning larger LLMs (up to 70B parameters) to offer richer context and smarter code generation. Integrated purpose-built agents for linting, security, and best practices, along with robust developer tooling (e.g., LSP integration for VSCode), will deliver a seamless and cost-effective coding experience.
