# Fuzzing Tests Framework Design

## Overview

The Anarchy Inference Fuzzing Tests Framework is designed to automatically generate random or semi-structured inputs to find bugs, edge cases, and security vulnerabilities in the Anarchy Inference language implementation. Fuzzing is a powerful testing technique that complements our existing testing infrastructure (unit tests, integration tests, stress tests) by exploring the input space more thoroughly and discovering issues that might not be covered by manually written tests.

This document outlines the design of the Fuzzing Tests Framework, including its architecture, components, integration with existing systems, and implementation plan.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the Fuzzing Tests Framework are:

1. **Bug Discovery**: Find bugs, crashes, and unexpected behaviors in the Anarchy Inference implementation
2. **Edge Case Identification**: Discover edge cases that might not be covered by existing tests
3. **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
4. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure that new changes don't introduce regressions
5. **Code Coverage Improvement**: Increase code coverage by exploring more execution paths

## Architecture

The Fuzzing Tests Framework will be organized into the following components:
