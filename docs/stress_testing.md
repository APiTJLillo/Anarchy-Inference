# Stress Testing Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Anarchy Inference Stress Testing Framework is a comprehensive solution for evaluating the robustness, stability, and performance of the Anarchy Inference language implementation under extreme conditions. This framework helps identify potential issues before they affect users in production environments.

The framework consists of several specialized components that work together to provide thorough testing of all aspects of the system:

1. **Stress Test Generator** - Creates test cases that push the system to its limits
2. **Resource Monitor** - Tracks resource usage during test execution
3. **Concurrency Stress Tester** - Tests behavior under high concurrency conditions
4. **Long-Running Test Manager** - Manages tests that run for extended periods
5. **Load Test Controller** - Applies varying loads to identify breaking points
6. **Fault Injector** - Deliberately introduces faults to test resilience

## Architecture

The Stress Testing Framework is designed with a modular architecture that allows components to be used independently or together through the integrated runner:

```

├── fault_injection/              # Fault injection components
│   └── fault_injector.py         # Introduces faults to test resilience
```

The integrated runner (`run_stress_tests.py`) provides a unified interface for running all components together with configurable test suites.

## Components

### Stress Test Generator

The Stress Test Generator creates test cases designed to stress different aspects of the Anarchy Inference system. It supports generating tests for:

- Memory stress (allocation patterns, large objects, circular references)
- Computational stress (CPU-intensive operations, complex algorithms)
- I/O stress (file operations, network operations)
- Mixed workloads (combinations of different stress types)

#### Usage Example

```python
from stress_testing.generators.stress_test_generator import StressTestGenerator, StressTestCategory, StressIntensity

# Create a generator
generator = StressTestGenerator()

# Generate a memory stress test with high intensity
test_code = generator.generate_test(StressTestCategory.MEMORY, StressIntensity.HIGH)

# Generate a test sequence with increasing intensity
from stress_testing.generators.stress_test_generator import TestSequencer
sequencer = TestSequencer()
test_sequence = sequencer.generate_test_sequence(StressTestCategory.MEMORY, StressIntensity.HIGH)
```

### Resource Monitor

The Resource Monitor tracks resource usage during test execution, providing insights into how the system behaves under stress. It includes:

- Memory Monitor (heap usage, allocation patterns, GC activity)
- CPU Monitor (CPU usage, hotspots)
- File Handle Tracker (open files, potential leaks)

#### Usage Example

```python
from stress_testing.monitors.resource_monitor import ResourceMonitor

# Create a monitor
monitor = ResourceMonitor()

# Start monitoring
monitor.start()

# Run your test code here
# ...

# Stop monitoring and get results
results = monitor.stop()
print(f"Peak memory usage: {results['memory']['peak_bytes'] / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
print(f"Average CPU usage: {results['cpu']['average_percent']:.2f}%")
```

### Concurrency Stress Tester

The Concurrency Stress Tester evaluates how the system behaves under concurrent execution conditions. It tests:

- Thread scaling (increasing thread count to find limits)
- Resource contention (creating contention for shared resources)
- Race conditions (scenarios likely to trigger race conditions)
- Deadlock scenarios (potential deadlock situations)

#### Usage Example

```python
from stress_testing.concurrency.concurrency_tester import ConcurrencyTester

# Create a tester with maximum 16 threads and 120 seconds duration
tester = ConcurrencyTester(max_threads=16, duration_seconds=120)

# Run concurrency tests
results = tester.run_tests()

print(f"Success: {results.success}")
if not results.success:
    print(f"Issues detected: {results.issues_detected}")
```

### Long-Running Test Manager

The Long-Running Test Manager executes tests for extended periods to identify issues that only appear after prolonged operation. It monitors:

- Stability over time (system stability during long runs)
- Performance degradation (detecting performance degradation)
- Memory leaks (identifying memory leaks during extended execution)
- Resource exhaustion (finding resource exhaustion patterns)

#### Usage Example

```python
from stress_testing.long_running.long_running_test_manager import LongRunningTestManager

# Create a manager with 3600 seconds (1 hour) duration
manager = LongRunningTestManager(duration_seconds=3600)

# Run long-running tests
results = manager.run_tests()

print(f"Success: {results.success}")
print(f"Memory growth rate: {results.memory_growth_rate:.2f} bytes/second")
```

### Load Test Controller

The Load Test Controller applies varying loads to the system to identify breaking points and performance degradation patterns. It supports different load patterns:

- Constant (steady, unchanging load)
- Step (load increases in steps)
- Ramp (load increases linearly)
- Spike (sudden spike in load)
- Wave (sinusoidal pattern)
- Random (random fluctuations)

#### Usage Example

```python
from stress_testing.load_testing.load_test_controller import LoadTestController, LoadPattern, LoadTestConfig

# Create a configuration for step pattern load testing
config = LoadTestConfig(
    pattern=LoadPattern.STEP,
    initial_load=10,
    max_load=100,
    duration_seconds=300,
    step_size=10,
    step_duration=30
)

# Create a controller and run the test
controller = LoadTestController(config)
results = controller.run_test()

print(f"Success: {results.success}")
if results.breaking_point:
    print(f"Breaking point detected at load level: {results.breaking_point}")
```

### Fault Injector

The Fault Injector deliberately introduces faults to test the resilience and error handling capabilities of the system. It supports various fault types:

- Memory corruption (corrupting memory structures)
- Resource exhaustion (exhausting system resources)
- Invalid input (providing invalid input)
- Syntax errors (introducing syntax errors)
- Runtime errors (causing runtime errors)
- Timeouts (forcing timeouts)
- Interrupts (sending interrupts)
- I/O errors (causing I/O errors)

#### Usage Example

```python
from stress_testing.fault_injection.fault_injector import FaultInjector, FaultType, FaultInjectionConfig

# Create a configuration for fault injection
config = FaultInjectionConfig(
    fault_types=[FaultType.INVALID_INPUT, FaultType.RUNTIME_ERROR],
    frequency=0.7,  # 70% chance of injecting a fault
    target_components=["parser", "interpreter"]
)

# Create an injector and run tests
injector = FaultInjector(config)
results = injector.run_tests(test_count=100)

print(f"Recovery success rate: {results.recovery_success_rate:.2%}")
print(f"Error handling quality: {results.error_handling_quality}")
```

## Integrated Stress Test Runner

The Integrated Stress Test Runner provides a unified interface for running all stress testing components together. It supports different test suites:

- Quick (quick tests for rapid feedback)
- Standard (standard test suite for regular testing)
- Comprehensive (comprehensive test suite for thorough testing)
- Nightly (extended test suite for nightly builds)
- Release (full test suite for release validation)

### Usage Example

```bash
# Run the standard test suite
python testing/run_stress_tests.py --suite standard

# Run a comprehensive test suite with parallel execution
python testing/run_stress_tests.py --suite comprehensive --parallel 4

# Run only specific components
python testing/run_stress_tests.py --include standard_stress fault_injection

# Exclude specific components
python testing/run_stress_tests.py --exclude long_running

# Set a random seed for reproducibility
python testing/run_stress_tests.py --seed 12345

# Adjust test duration
python testing/run_stress_tests.py --duration-multiplier 0.5  # Shorter tests
```

## Conclusion

The Stress Testing Framework provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating the robustness, stability, and performance of Anarchy Inference under extreme conditions. By integrating with the existing testing infrastructure, it enables thorough testing of all aspects of the system, helping to identify and address potential issues before they affect users in production environments.
