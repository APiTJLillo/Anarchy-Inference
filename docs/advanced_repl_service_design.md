# Advanced REPL Service Design for Anarchy Inference

## Overview

The Advanced REPL Service is a key component of the Language Hub Server for Anarchy Inference, providing a sophisticated environment for interactive code execution. Unlike traditional REPLs, this service offers multiple named sessions, state persistence, and real-time interpretation results through a modern HTTP/WebSocket API.

## Goals

1. Provide a modern, accessible interface for executing Anarchy Inference code
2. Support multiple concurrent sessions with independent state
3. Enable persistent sessions that survive server restarts
4. Deliver real-time execution results and feedback
5. Integrate with the LSP-like component for intelligent code assistance
6. Support both synchronous and asynchronous execution models

## Architecture

The Advanced REPL Service consists of the following components:

### 1. HTTP/WebSocket API Layer

- **HTTP Endpoints**:
  - Session management (create, list, delete)
  - Code execution (synchronous)
  - Session state retrieval
  - History management
  - Configuration

- **WebSocket Interface**:
  - Real-time code execution (asynchronous)
  - Streaming execution results
  - Interactive debugging
  - Live environment inspection
  - Event notifications

### 2. Session Management System

- **Session Registry**:
  - Named session tracking
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Resource allocation and cleanup
  - Session metadata and statistics

- **Session Context**:
  - Execution environment isolation
  - Variable and function scope management
  - Module import tracking
  - Resource usage monitoring

### 3. State Persistence Layer

- **Serialization System**:
  - Environment state serialization
  - Variable snapshot creation
  - Function and closure preservation
  - Module state tracking

- **Storage Backend**:
  - File-based persistence
  - Database integration (optional)
  - Configurable persistence policies
  - State versioning and rollback

### 4. Execution Engine

- **Interpreter Integration**:
  - Anarchy Inference interpreter binding
  - Execution context management
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Performance optimization

- **Real-time Feedback**:
  - Progressive result streaming
  - Execution metrics collection
  - Memory and CPU usage tracking
  - Execution visualization

## API Specification

### HTTP API

#### Session Management

```
POST /api/sessions
  - Create a new session
  - Parameters: name (optional), timeout, persistence

GET /api/sessions
  - List all available sessions
  - Parameters: filter, limit, offset

GET /api/sessions/{id}
  - Get session details
  - Parameters: includeState, includeHistory

DELETE /api/sessions/{id}
  - Delete a session
  - Parameters: force

PUT /api/sessions/{id}/config
  - Update session configuration
  - Parameters: timeout, persistence, etc.
```

#### Code Execution

```
POST /api/sessions/{id}/execute
  - Execute code synchronously
  - Parameters: code, timeout, captureOutput

GET /api/sessions/{id}/variables
  - Get all variables in the session
  - Parameters: filter, includeValues

GET /api/sessions/{id}/history
  - Get execution history
  - Parameters: limit, offset, includeResults
```

### WebSocket API

#### Connection

```
WebSocket /api/sessions/{id}/live
  - Establish a live connection to a session
```

#### Messages (Client to Server)

```json
{
  "type": "execute",
  "code": "let x = 10; print(x);",
  "id": "request-123",
  "options": {
    "timeout": 5000,
    "captureOutput": true
  }
}

{
  "type": "cancel",
  "executionId": "exec-456"
}

{
  "type": "inspect",
  "variable": "x",
  "depth": 2
}
```

#### Messages (Server to Client)

```json
{
  "type": "executionStart",
  "id": "exec-456",
  "requestId": "request-123",
  "timestamp": 1619712345678
}

{
  "type": "output",
  "executionId": "exec-456",
  "content": "10\n",
  "channel": "stdout"
}

{
  "type": "executionResult",
  "executionId": "exec-456",
  "result": {
    "type": "number",
    "value": 10
  },
  "duration": 15,
  "status": "success"
}

{
  "type": "error",
  "executionId": "exec-456",
  "error": {
    "type": "SyntaxError",
    "message": "Unexpected token",
    "location": {
      "line": 1,
      "column": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Session Isolation

Each session will have its own isolated execution environment to prevent interference between sessions. This includes:

- Separate variable scopes
- Independent module imports
- Isolated resource allocation
- Separate execution history

### State Persistence

Session state will be persisted using a combination of:

1. **Serialization**: Converting the execution environment to a serializable format
2. **Storage**: Saving the serialized state to disk or database
3. **Restoration**: Rebuilding the execution environment from the serialized state

The persistence system will handle complex objects, closures, and circular references.

### Real-time Execution

The WebSocket interface will provide real-time feedback during code execution:

1. Execution start notification
2. Progressive output streaming
3. Intermediate result updates
4. Resource usage metrics
5. Execution completion notification

### Integration with LSP-like Component

The Advanced REPL Service will integrate with the LSP-like component to provide:

1. Intelligent code completion in the REPL
2. Syntax highlighting and error detection
3. Documentation and type information
4. Code formatting and refactoring

## Security Considerations

1. **Resource Limits**: Each session will have configurable limits on:
   - Execution time
   - Memory usage
   - CPU usage
   - Network access

2. **Isolation**: Sessions will be isolated to prevent:
   - Cross-session data access
   - Resource contention
   - Denial of service attacks

3. **Authentication**: The API will support:
   - API key authentication
   - OAuth integration
   - Role-based access control

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Sessions will be loaded on demand to minimize resource usage
2. **Caching**: Frequently used sessions will be cached in memory
3. **Resource Pooling**: Execution resources will be pooled for efficiency
4. **Garbage Collection**: Unused resources will be automatically reclaimed
5. **Scaling**: The service will support horizontal scaling for high demand

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - HTTP server setup
   - WebSocket server implementation
   - Basic session management
   - Simple code execution

2. **Phase 2: Session Management**
   - Named sessions

   - Resource allocation and cleanup
   - Session metadata and statistics

3. **Phase 3: State Persistence**
   - Environment serialization
   - Storage backend integration
   - State restoration
   - Persistence policies

4. **Phase 4: Real-time Execution**
   - WebSocket communication
   - Progressive result streaming
   - Execution metrics
   - Interactive debugging

5. **Phase 5: Integration and Testing**
   - LSP integration
   - Security hardening
   - Performance optimization
   - Comprehensive testing

## Conclusion

The Advanced REPL Service will provide a powerful, modern interface for interactive Anarchy Inference code execution. With features like multiple named sessions, state persistence, and real-time feedback, it will significantly enhance the developer experience and enable new use cases for the language.
