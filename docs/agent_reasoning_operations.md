# Agent Reasoning Operations Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the agent reasoning operations implemented in Anarchy Inference. These operations enable AI agents to perform complex reasoning tasks while maintaining token efficiency, which is a core principle of the Anarchy Inference language.

## Core Reasoning Capabilities

Anarchy Inference supports five primary reasoning strategies:

1. **Conditional Reasoning** - Basic if-then reasoning for straightforward decision-making
2. **Heuristic Reasoning** - Goal-based and utility-based approaches for optimization
3. **ReAct Pattern** - Reason-Act-Observe loop for iterative problem-solving
4. **Self-Reflection** - Evaluation and refinement of reasoning processes
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - Coordination between specialized reasoning agents

## Syntax and Usage

### Conditional Reasoning

Use conditional reasoning for simple decision-making based on conditions:

```
// Define a condition and reasoning branches
let weather = λ⟨tool:get_weather⟩ "New York";
let activity = λ⟨reason:conditional⟩ weather.is_raining ? 
    "Visit a museum" : 
    "Go to the park";
```

### Heuristic Reasoning

Use heuristic reasoning for goal-based optimization:

```
// Define a goal and options
let goal = "Find the fastest route";
let options = ["Route A", "Route B", "Route C"];

// Apply heuristic reasoning
let best_route = λ⟨reason:heuristic⟩ {
    goal: goal,
    options: options
};
```

For utility-based reasoning, add a utility function:

```
// Define a utility function
let utility_fn = λ(route) => {
    if (route.includes("highway")) return 0.8;
    if (route.includes("toll")) return 0.6;
    return 0.4;
};

// Apply utility-based reasoning
let best_route = λ⟨reason:heuristic⟩ {
    goal: goal,
    options: options,
    utility_function: utility_fn
};
```

### ReAct Pattern

Use the ReAct pattern for iterative problem-solving with tools:

```
// Define a goal and available tools
let search_result = λ⟨reason:react⟩ {
    goal: "Find the population of France",
    tools: ["search", "extract_data"],
    max_iterations: 3
};
```

### Planning

Create and execute plans for complex goals:

```
// Create a plan for a complex goal
let travel_plan = λ⟨plan⟩ {
    destination: "Paris",
    duration: "7 days",
    budget: 2000,
    interests: ["art", "history", "food"]
};

// Execute the plan
let result = λ⟨execute_plan⟩ travel_plan;
```

### Self-Reflection

Reflect on reasoning processes to improve them:

```
// Reflect on a reasoning trace
let improved_reasoning = λ⟨reflect⟩ previous_reasoning_trace;
```

### Multi-Agent Reasoning

Coordinate multiple specialized agents:

```
// Define agents and a coordination strategy
let result = λ⟨reason:multi_agent⟩ {
    goal: "Solve a complex problem",
    agents: [
        "Research specialist",
        "Analysis specialist",
        "Decision maker"
    ],
    coordination_strategy: "hierarchical"
};
```

## Memory Integration

Reasoning operations are integrated with the agent memory system:

```
// Store a reasoning trace in memory
λ⟨memory:store⟩ {
    content: reasoning_trace,
    segment: "episodic",
    priority: "high"
};

// Retrieve relevant memories for reasoning
let relevant_memories = λ⟨memory:retrieve⟩ {
    query: "previous decision about routes",
    segments: ["episodic", "semantic"],
    limit: 5
};
```

## Tool Integration

Reasoning operations can use external tools:

```
// Use a search tool within reasoning
let search_result = λ⟨tool:search⟩ "population of France";

// Use a file system tool within reasoning
let file_content = λ⟨tool:read_file⟩ "/path/to/file.txt";

// Use a web tool within reasoning
let web_content = λ⟨tool:fetch_url⟩ "https://example.com";
```

## Token Efficiency

Anarchy Inference's reasoning operations are designed for token efficiency:

1. **Compact Representation** - Reasoning traces use a compressed format
2. **Selective Memory** - Only relevant context is included in reasoning
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complex reasoning is performed incrementally
4. **Reasoning Caching** - Common patterns are cached to avoid redundancy
5. **Optimized Tool Calling** - Tool calls are batched when possible

## Best Practices

### When to Use Different Reasoning Strategies

- **Conditional Reasoning**: Use for simple, deterministic decision-making
- **Heuristic Reasoning**: Use for optimization problems with clear goals
- **ReAct Pattern**: Use for tasks requiring multiple steps and tool use
- **Planning**: Use for complex goals requiring structured decomposition
- **Self-Reflection**: Use to improve reasoning quality over time
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning**: Use for problems benefiting from specialized expertise

### Memory Management

- Store important reasoning traces in episodic memory
- Use working memory for active reasoning context
- Consolidate frequent patterns into semantic memory

### Error Handling

Handle reasoning failures gracefully:

```
try {
    let result = λ⟨reason:react⟩ { /* ... */ };
} catch (error) {
    // Handle reasoning failure
    let fallback_result = λ⟨reason:conditional⟩ { /* ... */ };
}
```

## Examples

See the `examples.rs` file for complete examples of each reasoning strategy.

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Reasoning Strategies

You can define custom reasoning strategies by implementing the `ReasoningStrategy` trait:

```rust
pub struct CustomReasoning;

impl ReasoningStrategy for CustomReasoning {
    fn apply(&self, context: &MemoryContext, input: &Value) -> Result<Value, LangError> {
        // Custom reasoning implementation
    }
    
    fn get_type(&self) -> ReasoningType {
        ReasoningType::Custom
    }
}
```

### Combining Reasoning Strategies

Complex reasoning can combine multiple strategies:

```
// Use conditional reasoning to select a strategy
let strategy = λ⟨reason:conditional⟩ is_complex ? 
    "react" : 
    "conditional";

// Apply the selected strategy
let result = λ⟨reason:${strategy}⟩ { /* ... */ };
```

### Reasoning with Uncertainty

Handle uncertainty in reasoning:

```
// Define a probabilistic model
let model = λ⟨probability:model⟩ {
    variables: ["weather", "traffic"],
    dependencies: [/* ... */]
};

// Reason with uncertainty
let decision = λ⟨reason:probabilistic⟩ {
    model: model,
    query: "best_route",
    evidence: { weather: "rainy" }
};
```

## Conclusion

Anarchy Inference's agent reasoning operations provide a powerful framework for implementing sophisticated agent behaviors while maintaining token efficiency. By combining different reasoning strategies with memory and tool integration, you can create agents capable of complex problem-solving and decision-making.
