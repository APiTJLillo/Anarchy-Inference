# Stress Testing Framework Design for Anarchy Inference

## Overview

The Stress Testing Framework is designed to evaluate the robustness, stability, and performance of Anarchy Inference under extreme conditions. Unlike regular unit tests or benchmarks that focus on correctness and performance under normal conditions, stress tests deliberately push the system to its limits to identify breaking points, resource leaks, and performance degradation patterns.

This framework integrates with the existing testing infrastructure, including the Record/Replay System, Automated Test Generation, Coverage Analysis, and Performance Benchmarking components.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Robustness Testing**: Identify conditions under which the Anarchy Inference interpreter fails or produces unexpected results
2. **Resource Management Testing**: Detect memory leaks, excessive CPU usage, and other resource management issues
3. **Concurrency Testing**: Evaluate behavior under high concurrency and parallel execution scenarios
4. **Long-Running Testing**: Assess stability during extended execution periods
5. **Load Testing**: Determine performance characteristics under varying loads
6. **Recovery Testing**: Verify system recovery after failures or resource exhaustion
