# Onboarding Agents Design Document

## Overview

The Onboarding Agents component provides a suite of intelligent agents designed to help new users learn and adopt Anarchy Inference effectively. These agents guide users through the learning process, provide interactive tutorials, offer contextual help, and assist with project setup and best practices.

## Goals

1. Reduce the learning curve for new Anarchy Inference users
2. Provide interactive, hands-on learning experiences
3. Offer contextual help and documentation
4. Guide users through project setup and configuration
5. Demonstrate best practices and common patterns

## Components

### 1. Tutorial Agent

The Tutorial Agent provides interactive, step-by-step tutorials for learning Anarchy Inference concepts and features.

#### Features
- Progressive, hands-on tutorials from basic to advanced topics
- Interactive code examples with explanations
- Exercises with automated validation and feedback
- Progress tracking and personalized learning paths
- Integration with the REPL for immediate practice

### 2. Documentation Agent

The Documentation Agent provides contextual help, reference information, and examples based on user queries or code context.

#### Features
- Natural language query processing for documentation lookup
- Context-aware documentation suggestions
- Code snippet generation based on documentation
- Integration with external resources and references
- Explanation of error messages and warnings

### 3. Project Setup Agent

The Project Setup Agent helps users create and configure new Anarchy Inference projects with appropriate structure and dependencies.

#### Features
- Project templates for different application types
- Guided project configuration
- Dependency management assistance
- Build and deployment configuration
- Integration with existing codebases

### 4. Best Practices Agent

The Best Practices Agent provides guidance on Anarchy Inference coding standards, patterns, and optimization techniques.

#### Features
- Code review with best practice suggestions
- Pattern recommendations based on use case
- Performance optimization guidance
- Security and reliability recommendations
- Token optimization for LLM-oriented code

## Architecture

The Onboarding Agents are built on a common agent framework with these key components:

1. **Knowledge Base**: Contains tutorials, documentation, templates, and best practices
2. **Context Manager**: Tracks user progress, preferences, and current context
3. **Interaction Engine**: Handles user queries and provides responses
4. **Code Analysis**: Analyzes user code for providing contextual help
5. **Code Generation**: Creates example code and project templates

## Integration Points

The Onboarding Agents integrate with:

1. **Language Hub Server**: For code analysis and execution
2. **LSP Component**: For editor integration and contextual help
3. **REPL Service**: For interactive tutorials and examples
4. **Build/Pack Tools**: For project setup and configuration

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core framework and knowledge base
2. **Phase 2**: Tutorial Agent implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Documentation Agent implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Project Setup Agent implementation
5. **Phase 5**: Best Practices Agent implementation
6. **Phase 6**: Integration and testing

## Success Metrics

1. Time to first successful program for new users
2. Tutorial completion rates
3. Documentation query success rate
4. User satisfaction with project setup
5. Adoption of best practices in user code

## Future Extensions

1. Community-contributed tutorials and examples
2. Domain-specific onboarding paths
3. Integration with learning management systems
4. Personalized learning recommendations
5. Certification and skill assessment
