# Build/Pack Tools Design Document

## Overview

The Build/Pack Tools component provides a comprehensive system for packaging, building, and deploying Anarchy Inference code. It enables developers to easily create distributable packages, integrate with existing Rust projects, deploy as microservices, and compile to WebAssembly.

## Goals

1. Provide a single command packaging system for Anarchy Inference projects
2. Enable seamless integration with existing Rust codebases
3. Support microservice deployment with standardized templates
4. Enable WebAssembly compilation for browser and edge deployment
5. Ensure consistent build processes across different environments

## Architecture

The Build/Pack Tools component consists of four main modules:

1. **Packaging System**: Core functionality for creating distributable packages
2. **Integration Hooks**: Tools for integrating with Rust and other languages
3. **Deployment Templates**: Standardized templates for various deployment targets
4. **WASM Compilation**: Support for compiling to WebAssembly

### Packaging System

The packaging system provides a unified approach to bundling Anarchy Inference code and dependencies:

- **Package Definition**: Standard format for defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic resolution and fetching of dependencies
- **Asset Bundling**: Inclusion of non-code assets like configuration and resources
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning support with compatibility checking
- **Package Registry**: Integration with central package registry for sharing

### Integration Hooks

Integration hooks enable Anarchy Inference code to be used within other language ecosystems:

- **Rust Integration**: First-class support for using Anarchy Inference within Rust projects
- **FFI Generation**: Automatic generation of foreign function interfaces
- **Build System Integration**: Hooks for Cargo, npm, and other build systems
- **API Wrapping**: Tools for creating idiomatic APIs in host languages

### Deployment Templates

Deployment templates provide standardized approaches for different deployment scenarios:

- **Microservice Template**: Ready-to-use template for deploying as a standalone microservice
- **Serverless Template**: Configuration for serverless deployment (AWS Lambda, etc.)
- **Container Template**: Docker and Kubernetes configuration
- **Edge Computing Template**: Optimized deployment for edge computing environments

### WASM Compilation

WASM compilation enables Anarchy Inference code to run in browsers and other WASM environments:

- **WASM Target**: Compilation target for WebAssembly
- **Browser Runtime**: Runtime support for browser environments
- **Size Optimization**: Techniques for minimizing WASM binary size
- **JavaScript Interop**: Seamless interaction with JavaScript code

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will proceed in the following phases:

1. **Core Packaging System** (2 weeks)
   - Package format definition
   - Dependency resolution
   - Basic command-line interface

2. **Integration Hooks** (2 weeks)
   - Rust integration
   - Build system hooks
   - FFI generation

3. **Deployment Templates** (2 weeks)
   - Microservice template
   - Container configuration
   - Deployment scripts

4. **WASM Compilation** (2 weeks)
   - WASM target implementation
   - Browser runtime
   - JavaScript interop

## Command-Line Interface

The Build/Pack Tools will be accessible through a unified command-line interface:

```
anarchy-pack [command] [options]
```

Commands:
- `init`: Initialize a new package
- `build`: Build the package
- `test`: Run tests
- `publish`: Publish to registry
- `deploy`: Deploy using specified template
- `integrate`: Generate integration code

## Integration with Language Hub Server

The Build/Pack Tools will integrate with other Language Hub Server components:

- **LSP-like Component**: Code analysis for optimized builds
- **Advanced REPL Service**: Testing and validation during build process

## Security Considerations

- Dependency verification to prevent supply chain attacks
- Sandboxed build environment
- Permission-based deployment
- Secure credential handling

## Performance Considerations

- Incremental builds for faster development cycles
- Parallel dependency resolution
- Optimized compilation for different targets
- Caching of intermediate build artifacts

## Future Extensions

- IDE integration for one-click builds and deployment
- Visual build pipeline editor
- Performance profiling during build
- Cross-platform binary distribution
