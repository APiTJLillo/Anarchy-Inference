# Validation Tools for Anarchy Inference

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Validation Tools component of Anarchy Inference. These tools help developers ensure their code is correct, efficient, and secure.

## Overview

The Validation Tools consist of four main components:

1. **Static Analysis** - Analyzes code without executing it to find syntax errors, style issues, and potential bugs
2. **Runtime Verification** - Monitors code execution to detect runtime issues and verify correctness
3. **Security Scanning** - Identifies security vulnerabilities and potential exploits
4. **Resource Usage Analysis** - Analyzes resource consumption and identifies performance bottlenecks

These tools can be used individually or together to provide comprehensive validation of Anarchy Inference code.

## Static Analysis

The Static Analyzer examines code without executing it to identify potential issues.

### Features

- **Syntax Validation** - Checks for syntax errors and structural issues
- **Style Checking** - Enforces coding standards and best practices
- **Type Checking** - Verifies type consistency and identifies type-related issues
- **Control Flow Analysis** - Analyzes code paths and identifies unreachable code
- **Naming Convention Enforcement** - Ensures consistent naming conventions

### Usage

```python
from validation_tools.static_analyzer import StaticAnalyzer

# Create a static analyzer
analyzer = StaticAnalyzer()

# Analyze a single file
results = analyzer.analyze_file("/path/to/file.ai")

# Analyze a directory
results = analyzer.analyze_directory("/path/to/directory")

# Generate a report
report = analyzer.generate_report(results, "text")  # or "json" or "html"
print(report)
```

### Configuration

The Static Analyzer can be configured with custom rules:

```python
from validation_tools.static_analyzer import StaticAnalyzer, PatternRule

# Create a custom rule
custom_rule = PatternRule(
    rule_id="CUSTOM001",
    description="Custom pattern rule",
    pattern=r"pattern_to_match",
    message_template="Found {match}",
    suggestion_template="Consider replacing {match}",
    severity="warning",
    category="custom"
)

# Add the rule to the analyzer
analyzer = StaticAnalyzer()
analyzer.add_rule(custom_rule)
```

## Runtime Verification

The Runtime Verifier monitors code execution to detect runtime issues and verify correctness.

### Features

- **Assertion Checking** - Verifies runtime conditions and invariants
- **Contract Verification** - Enforces pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants
- **Exception Monitoring** - Tracks and analyzes runtime exceptions
- **State Tracking** - Monitors program state changes during execution
- **Temporal Property Verification** - Verifies sequences of events and timing constraints

### Usage

```python
from validation_tools.runtime_verifier import RuntimeVerifier

# Create a runtime verifier
verifier = RuntimeVerifier()

# Define a verification specification
spec = """
always(x > 0)
eventually(y == 10)
"""

# Verify a function against the specification
def test_function():
    x = 5
    y = 10
    return x + y

result = verifier.verify(test_function, spec)
print(result.is_valid)  # True or False
print(result.violations)  # List of violations if any
```

### Monitoring Mode

The Runtime Verifier can also be used in monitoring mode to track execution:

```python
# Start monitoring
verifier.start_monitoring()

# Run code
test_function()

# Stop monitoring and get results
results = verifier.stop_monitoring()
print(results)
```

## Security Scanning

The Security Scanner identifies security vulnerabilities and potential exploits in code.

### Features

- **Vulnerability Detection** - Identifies common security vulnerabilities
- **Taint Analysis** - Tracks untrusted data flow through the program
- **Secret Detection** - Finds hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **Injection Attack Detection** - Identifies SQL, command, and other injection vulnerabilities
- **Security Best Practices** - Enforces security best practices

### Usage

```python
from validation_tools.security_scanner import SecurityScanner

# Create a security scanner
scanner = SecurityScanner()

# Scan a single file
results = scanner.scan_file("/path/to/file.ai")

# Scan a directory
results = scanner.scan_directory("/path/to/directory")

# Generate a report
report = scanner.generate_report(results, "text")  # or "json" or "html"
print(report)
```

### Custom Security Rules

The Security Scanner can be extended with custom security rules:

```python
from validation_tools.security_scanner import SecurityScanner, PatternSecurityRule

# Create a custom security rule
custom_rule = PatternSecurityRule(
    rule_id="CUSTOM_SEC001",
    description="Custom security rule",
    pattern=r"unsafe_function\(",
    message_template="Use of unsafe function",
    suggestion_template="Consider using safe_function instead",
    severity="critical",
    category="custom_security"
)

# Add the rule to the scanner
scanner = SecurityScanner()
scanner.add_rule(custom_rule)
```

## Resource Usage Analysis

The Resource Analyzer analyzes resource consumption and identifies performance bottlenecks.

### Features

- **Token Usage Analysis** - Analyzes token efficiency and identifies token-heavy code
- **Memory Usage Analysis** - Detects memory leaks and inefficient memory usage
- **Complexity Analysis** - Identifies code with high complexity that may impact performance
- **Performance Profiling** - Measures execution time and resource consumption
- **Resource Leak Detection** - Identifies unclosed resources and potential leaks

### Usage

```python
from validation_tools.resource_analyzer import ResourceUsageAnalyzer

# Create a resource analyzer
analyzer = ResourceUsageAnalyzer()

# Analyze a single file
results = analyzer.analyze_file("/path/to/file.ai")

# Analyze a directory
results = analyzer.analyze_directory("/path/to/directory")

# Generate a report
report = analyzer.generate_report(results, "text")  # or "json" or "html"
print(report)
```

### Execution Profiling

The Resource Analyzer can also profile function execution:

```python
# Profile a function
def test_function():
    # Some code that uses resources
    pass

result, metrics = analyzer.profile_execution(test_function)

print(f"Memory usage: {metrics.memory_usage} bytes")
print(f"Execution time: {metrics.execution_time} seconds")
print(f"Token usage: {metrics.token_usage} tokens")
```

## Integration

All validation tools can be used together for comprehensive validation:

```python
from validation_tools.static_analyzer import StaticAnalyzer
from validation_tools.runtime_verifier import RuntimeVerifier
from validation_tools.security_scanner import SecurityScanner
from validation_tools.resource_analyzer import ResourceUsageAnalyzer

# Create all tools
static_analyzer = StaticAnalyzer()
runtime_verifier = RuntimeVerifier()
security_scanner = SecurityScanner()
resource_analyzer = ResourceUsageAnalyzer()

# Analyze a file with all tools
file_path = "/path/to/file.ai"
static_results = static_analyzer.analyze_file(file_path)
security_results = security_scanner.scan_file(file_path)
resource_results = resource_analyzer.analyze_file(file_path)

# Combine results
all_results = static_results + security_results + resource_results

# Generate a combined report
report = static_analyzer.generate_report(all_results, "html")

# Save the report
with open("validation_report.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(report)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run validation tools regularly** - Integrate validation into your development workflow
2. **Address high-severity issues first** - Focus on critical and high-severity issues
3. **Use all validation tools together** - Each tool catches different types of issues
4. **Customize rules for your project** - Add project-specific rules to catch common issues
5. **Generate reports for documentation** - Save validation reports for future reference
6. **Automate validation in CI/CD** - Run validation tools automatically in your CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The Validation Tools provide a comprehensive suite for ensuring Anarchy Inference code is correct, efficient, and secure. By using these tools regularly, developers can catch issues early and maintain high-quality code.
