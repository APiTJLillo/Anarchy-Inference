# Garbage Collection System Design for Anarchy Inference

## Overview

This document outlines the design for the garbage collection system in Anarchy Inference. The system uses a hybrid approach combining reference counting with cycle detection to efficiently manage memory while maintaining the language's token efficiency goals.

## Design Goals

1. **Efficiency**: Minimize overhead during normal execution
2. **Correctness**: Properly handle all memory management scenarios including reference cycles
3. **Configurability**: Allow customization of collection behavior
4. **Transparency**: Provide clear insights into memory usage
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly work with the existing language features
6. **Token Efficiency**: Support the language's primary goal of minimizing token usage

## Architecture

The garbage collection system consists of the following components:

### 1. Core Components

#### GarbageCollector

The central component responsible for tracking objects, managing reference counts, and performing collection operations.

Key responsibilities:
- Object allocation and tracking
- Reference count management
- Cycle detection and collection
- Memory usage statistics
- Automatic collection based on configurable thresholds

#### GcValue

A wrapper for values managed by the garbage collector, providing:
- Reference to the actual value
- Connection to the garbage collector
- Reference tracking
- Automatic cleanup on drop

#### GcValueImpl

Concrete implementations of complex values that need garbage collection:
- Objects (key-value maps)
- Arrays (ordered collections)
- Functions (with closures)
- Other complex types

### 2. Memory Management Strategies

#### Reference Counting

Primary memory management strategy:
- Each object has a reference count tracking how many references point to it
- When count reaches zero, object can be collected
- Efficient for most usage patterns
- Immediate collection of unreferenced objects

#### Cycle Detection

Supplementary strategy to handle reference cycles:
- Mark-and-sweep algorithm to detect unreachable cycles
- Runs periodically or when memory usage exceeds threshold
- Only processes objects that might form cycles
- Uses graph traversal to identify unreachable objects

### 3. Collection Policies

#### Automatic Collection

- Triggered when memory usage exceeds configurable threshold
- Can be enabled/disabled
- Threshold can be adjusted based on application needs

#### Manual Collection

- Explicit API for forcing collection
- Useful for performance-critical sections

#### Collection Phases

1. **Reference Count Collection**: Remove objects with zero reference count
2. **Cycle Detection**: Mark reachable objects from roots
3. **Cycle Collection**: Remove unmarked objects that form cycles

### 4. Memory Tracking

- Size estimation for different value types
- Total memory usage tracking
- Collection statistics (allocations, deallocations, cycles detected)
- Performance metrics (collection time, memory saved)

## API Design

### GarbageCollector API

```rust
// Creation and configuration
fn new() -> Self
fn with_settings(threshold: usize, auto_collect: bool) -> Self
fn set_collection_threshold(&self, threshold: usize)
fn set_auto_collect(&self, enabled: bool)

// Memory management
fn allocate(&self, value: GcValueImpl) -> GcValue
fn collect(&self)
fn force_collect(&self)

// Reference management
fn increment_ref_count(&self, id: usize)
fn decrement_ref_count(&self, id: usize)
fn update_references(&self, id: usize, references: HashSet<usize>)

// Information and statistics
fn get_stats(&self) -> GcStats
fn memory_usage(&self) -> usize
fn get_collection_threshold(&self) -> usize
fn is_auto_collect_enabled(&self) -> bool
```

### GcValue API

```rust
// Value operations
fn get(&self) -> Value
fn set(&self, value: Value)

// Reference management
fn extract_references(value: &GcValueImpl) -> HashSet<usize>
fn get_size(value: &GcValueImpl) -> usize
```

### GcValueImpl API

```rust
// Creation
fn new_object() -> Self
fn new_array(elements: Vec<Value>) -> Self
fn new_function(name: String, parameters: Vec<String>, body: Box<ASTNode>, closure: Arc<Environment>) -> Self

// Type information
fn type_name(&self) -> &'static str
fn might_form_cycle(&self) -> bool

// Object operations
fn get_property(&self, name: &str) -> Option<Value>
fn set_property(&mut self, name: String, value: Value) -> bool

// Array operations
fn get_element(&self, index: usize) -> Option<Value>
fn set_element(&mut self, index: usize, value: Value) -> bool
```

## Integration with Language Features

### 1. Value System Integration

The garbage collector integrates with the language's value system by:
- Adding a `GcManaged` variant to the `Value` enum
- Providing transparent access to managed values
- Handling reference updates during value operations

### 2. Interpreter Integration

The interpreter integrates with the garbage collector by:
- Initializing the garbage collector during startup
- Managing the garbage collector's lifecycle
- Triggering collection at appropriate times
- Using garbage-collected values for complex data structures

### 3. Module System Integration

The garbage collector is exposed as a module in the language, allowing:
- Explicit control over garbage collection behavior
- Access to memory usage statistics
- Configuration of collection parameters

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Overhead

- Each managed object requires additional memory for tracking
- Reference counting adds overhead to value operations
- Cycle detection requires additional memory during collection

### 2. CPU Overhead

- Reference counting adds small overhead to value operations
- Cycle detection can be expensive but runs infrequently
- Collection pauses can impact real-time applications

### 3. Optimization Strategies

- Incremental collection to spread collection cost
- Generational collection to focus on recently allocated objects
- Thread-local allocation to reduce contention
- Custom memory pools for frequently allocated types

## Implementation Plan

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - Implement the `GarbageCollector` struct
   - Implement the `GcValue` wrapper
   - Implement the `GcValueImpl` enum

2. **Integration**:
   - Integrate with the value system
   - Integrate with the interpreter
   - Expose configuration API

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for language features
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Memory leak tests

4. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Performance guidelines

## Conclusion

This garbage collection system design provides a robust, efficient, and configurable solution for memory management in Anarchy Inference. By combining reference counting with cycle detection, it offers immediate collection of most objects while still handling complex reference patterns. The design supports the language's token efficiency goals while providing the necessary memory management capabilities for complex applications.
