# Anarchy Inference: Team Expansion Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for expanding the Anarchy Inference team beyond its current one-person structure. The strategy addresses a key concern raised by grant reviewers while ensuring sustainable growth aligned with project goals and funding realities. The plan includes phased hiring priorities, recruitment approaches, compensation models, onboarding processes, and team structure evolution as the project matures.
