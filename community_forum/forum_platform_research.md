## Recommendation

Based on the requirements and evaluation, **GitHub Discussions** is the recommended platform for the Anarchy Inference community forum for the following reasons:

1. **Seamless integration** with the existing GitHub repository where the project is hosted
2. **Zero additional cost** for hosting or maintenance
3. **Low barrier to entry** for users already following the project on GitHub
4. **Good support for code sharing** with syntax highlighting
5. **Minimal setup and maintenance** requirements
6. **Searchable knowledge base** that stays with the project repository

GitHub Discussions provides the best balance of features, integration, and low maintenance overhead for an open-source project at this stage. It allows the community to grow organically within the existing GitHub ecosystem where development is already happening.

## Implementation Plan

1. Enable GitHub Discussions on the repository
2. Set up initial discussion categories:
   - Announcements
   - General Discussion
   - Ideas & Feature Requests
   - Q&A / Help
   - Show & Tell (for sharing projects)
   - Token Efficiency Techniques
3. Create welcome post and community guidelines
4. Add forum information to README and website
5. Create initial seed discussions to encourage participation

As the community grows, we can reassess whether a more robust platform like Discourse would be beneficial.
