## Script Outline

### Introduction
"Welcome to this demonstration of Anarchy Inference, a token-minimal programming language designed specifically for LLM efficiency. In this video, we'll show you how Anarchy Inference significantly reduces token usage compared to traditional programming languages, while maintaining full functionality and readability."

### Token Counting Setup
"Before we dive into the examples, let's set up our token counting environment. We'll be using the token calculator tool from the Anarchy Inference project to count tokens for each language. This tool uses the same tokenization method as OpenAI's GPT models, ensuring accurate comparisons."

### Example Transitions
"Now let's look at a real-world example: [task description]. Here's how you would implement this in [language], which uses [X] tokens. And here's the equivalent implementation in Anarchy Inference, which uses only [Y] tokens - a reduction of [Z]%."

### Cost Analysis
"Let's translate these token savings into actual cost. Based on current OpenAI API pricing of $0.002 per 1K tokens for GPT-4, the token reduction we've demonstrated would save [amount] per 1000 code generations. For a team generating code regularly, this could mean savings of [larger amount] annually."

### Conclusion
"As we've seen throughout this demonstration, Anarchy Inference consistently reduces token usage by 30-50% compared to traditional programming languages. This efficiency translates directly to cost savings, faster response times, and the ability to fit more complex programs within token limits. We invite you to try Anarchy Inference for your LLM code generation needs."
