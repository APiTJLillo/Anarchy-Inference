## Key Deliverables

### 1. Benchmark Framework
The benchmark framework quantifies token efficiency by comparing Anarchy Inference with Python, JavaScript, and Rust across various programming tasks. The framework includes:

- `benchmark_framework.py`: Main script for token analysis
- `code_samples/`: Equivalent implementations in multiple languages
- `generate_sample_data.py`: Script to create consistent test data

### 2. Demonstration Applications
Five real-world applications showcase practical use cases of Anarchy Inference:

- Web Scraper: News article scraper with sentiment analysis
- Data Analyzer: Statistical analysis tool for CSV data
- API Client: Robust API client with caching and rate limiting
- UI Application: Data visualization interface with interactive charts
- File System Utility: File management with backup and synchronization

### 3. Project Website
A complete website to showcase the project:

- Interactive visualizations of token efficiency
- Side-by-side code comparisons
- Comprehensive language documentation
- Detailed benchmark results

### 4. Deployment Solution
Implementation of GitHub Pages hosting:

- `deploy_github_pages.sh`: Script to prepare and deploy the website
- Instructions for configuring custom domain (anarchydevelopment.com)
- DNS configuration guidance

### 5. Documentation and Reports
Comprehensive documentation and analysis:

- `final_report.md`: Summary of all enhancements and recommendations
- `grant_application_review.md`: Initial review of grant application
- `updated_todo_list.md`: Prioritized action items
- `website_hosting_options.md`: Analysis of hosting options

## Next Steps

1. Execute the deployment script to publish the website:
   ```
   chmod +x deploy_github_pages.sh
   ./deploy_github_pages.sh
   ```

2. Follow the instructions provided by the script to complete the GitHub Pages setup and DNS configuration.

3. Run the benchmark framework with actual measurements and update the results.

4. Update grant applications using the recommendations in the final report.

5. Refer to the updated todo list for prioritized future actions.
