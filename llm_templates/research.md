# LLM Code Generation Templates Research

## Overview

Creating effective code generation templates for Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for helping developers use Anarchy Inference efficiently. This research document explores best practices for prompt engineering, examines the specific requirements for different LLM platforms, and outlines strategies for creating templates that will produce optimal Anarchy Inference code.

## LLM Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### General Principles

1. **Be Specific and Clear**
   - Provide explicit instructions about the desired output format
   - Specify the programming language (Anarchy Inference) and its syntax rules
   - Include examples of well-formed code in the prompt

2. **Use Few-Shot Learning**
   - Include 2-3 examples of input-output pairs
   - Demonstrate different patterns and use cases
   - Show both simple and complex examples

3. **Structure Prompts Consistently**
   - Use clear sections: context, task description, examples, request
   - Include markers like "Input:", "Output:", "Example:"
   - Use consistent formatting across all templates

4. **Provide Context**
   - Explain what Anarchy Inference is
   - Highlight its token efficiency benefits
   - Mention key syntax differences from mainstream languages

5. **Include Constraints and Requirements**
   - Specify token efficiency goals
   - Mention readability requirements
   - Include error handling expectations

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)

- Supports system messages for setting context
- Works well with structured JSON outputs
- Benefits from temperature adjustments (0.2-0.4 for code)
- Responds to explicit formatting instructions

#### Anthropic Claude

- Prefers more natural language instructions
- Works well with XML-style tags for structure
- Benefits from explicit role assignment
- May require more detailed explanations of syntax

#### Google Gemini

- Works well with markdown formatting
- Benefits from step-by-step reasoning
- Responds to explicit requests for code comments
- May need more examples than other models

#### Open Source Models (Llama, Mistral)

- May require more detailed prompts
- Benefit from more examples
- May need explicit instruction to avoid hallucinating features
- Often work better with temperature adjustments

## Anarchy Inference Specific Considerations

### Syntax Highlighting

Templates should include instructions for proper syntax highlighting:
- Function definitions: `f(x)=x+1`
- Conditionals: `?(condition){...}`
- Loops: `@(init;condition;increment){...}`
- Variables: `x=5`

### Token Efficiency Techniques

Templates should emphasize:
- Using single-character variable names for local scope
- Minimizing whitespace while maintaining readability
- Using implicit returns where possible
- Avoiding unnecessary parentheses
- Using built-in functions efficiently

### Common Patterns

Templates should include patterns for:
- File operations
- Web requests
- Data processing
- String manipulation
- Error handling

## Template Structure

Each template should include:

1. **Header**
   - Description of the template purpose
   - Target LLM platform
   - Version number

2. **Context Section**
   - Brief explanation of Anarchy Inference
   - Key syntax elements
   - Token efficiency benefits

3. **Task Description**
   - Clear description of the coding task
   - Input/output expectations
   - Performance considerations

4. **Examples**
   - 2-3 examples of similar tasks
   - Both input requirements and Anarchy Inference solutions
   - Comments explaining token efficiency choices

5. **Request**
   - Specific request for Anarchy Inference code
   - Format requirements
   - Evaluation criteria (token count, readability, etc.)

## Testing Methodology

Templates should be tested by:

1. Submitting the same programming tasks to different LLMs
2. Comparing token counts of generated code
3. Evaluating code correctness
4. Assessing readability and maintainability
5. Measuring consistency across multiple generations
