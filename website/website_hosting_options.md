## Recommendation

**For your current needs, GitHub Pages is the recommended option because:**

1. **Cost-Effective:** It's completely free, which aligns with your budget constraints mentioned in previous conversations.

2. **Integration:** Your project is already on GitHub, making deployment seamless.

3. **Simplicity:** The setup is straightforward and requires minimal maintenance.

4. **Appropriateness:** Your website is primarily static content (documentation, benchmarks, examples), which is perfect for GitHub Pages.

5. **Professional Appearance:** GitHub Pages supports custom domains with HTTPS, providing a professional appearance with anarchydevelopment.com.

6. **Future Flexibility:** You can easily migrate to a more robust solution later if needed as your project grows.

## Implementation Plan for GitHub Pages

1. Create a `gh-pages` branch in your repository
2. Move website files to this branch or set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Add a CNAME file containing `anarchydevelopment.com`
5. Configure DNS with your domain registrar:
   - Add an A record pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses
   - Add CNAME record for www subdomain
6. Wait for DNS propagation (typically 24-48 hours)
7. Verify HTTPS is working correctly

This approach gives you a professional website with your custom domain at no additional cost, allowing you to focus your resources on development and grant applications.
