# Testing Tools Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the Testing Tools component of Anarchy Inference, which includes four key features:
1. Record/Replay System
2. Automated Test Generation
3. Coverage Analysis
4. Performance Benchmarking

The design builds upon the existing `automated_testing_framework.py` while extending it with new capabilities to fulfill the requirements in the TODO list.

## System Components

### 1. Record/Replay System

#### Purpose
Capture and reproduce the execution of Anarchy Inference code to enable deterministic testing and debugging.

#### Design
- **Recorder**: Captures the execution state, inputs, and outputs at defined checkpoints
- **State Serializer**: Converts execution state to a storable format
- **Replayer**: Reproduces execution from saved state
- **Expectation Manager**: Manages `.exp` files containing expected outputs

#### Key Features
- Deterministic execution replay
- Checkpoint system for partial execution
- Human-readable expectation files
- Automatic expectation file updating
- Diff visualization for expectation changes

### 2. Automated Test Generation

#### Purpose
Automatically generate test cases to improve code coverage and find edge cases.

#### Design
- **Template Engine**: Creates test cases from templates
- **Fuzzer**: Generates random but valid Anarchy Inference code
- **Mutation Engine**: Creates variations of existing tests
- **Oracle**: Validates generated test outputs
- **Test Selector**: Prioritizes tests based on coverage and other metrics

#### Key Features
- Template-based test generation
- Fuzzing capabilities for edge case discovery
- Mutation-based test generation
- Test case minimization
- Integration with record/replay system

### 3. Coverage Analysis

#### Design
- **Instrumentation Engine**: Adds tracking code to Anarchy Inference
- **Execution Tracker**: Records which parts of code are executed
- **Coverage Reporter**: Generates human-readable reports
- **Coverage Database**: Stores historical coverage data
- **Uncovered Code Analyzer**: Identifies code not covered by tests

#### Key Features
- Statement, branch, and path coverage
- Visual coverage reports
- Coverage trend analysis
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Uncovered code highlighting

### 4. Performance Benchmarking

#### Design
- **Benchmark Runner**: Executes performance tests
- **Metric Collector**: Gathers performance data
- **Comparison Engine**: Compares against baselines and other languages
- **Visualization Tool**: Creates charts and graphs
- **Regression Detector**: Identifies performance regressions

#### Key Features
- Execution time measurement
- Memory usage tracking
- Token efficiency comparison
- Performance regression detection
- Cross-language benchmarking

## Integration Architecture

The four components will be integrated through:

1. **Common Data Model**: Shared representation of test cases, results, and metrics
2. **Unified CLI**: Single command-line interface for all testing tools
3. **Event System**: Publish-subscribe system for component communication
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design for adding new testing capabilities
5. **Configuration System**: Flexible configuration for all components

## Implementation Strategy

1. Extend the existing `automated_testing_framework.py` with new classes
2. Implement each component as a separate module
3. Create integration points between components
4. Develop a unified CLI for all testing tools
5. Add comprehensive documentation and examples

## Dependencies

- Existing Anarchy Inference codebase
- Python standard library
- Minimal external dependencies for core functionality
- Optional visualization libraries for reporting
