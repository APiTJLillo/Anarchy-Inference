# LLM Knowledge Base System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for an LLM-powered knowledge base system that will extract, organize, and make accessible the collective knowledge shared in the Anarchy Inference Discord community. The system will automatically process conversations, identify valuable information, and transform it into structured documentation.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Collection Layer

## Implementation Components

### 1. Discord Bot Implementation

```javascript
// Core bot functionality
const { Client, Intents, MessageEmbed } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] });

// Knowledge processing modules
const knowledgeProcessor = require('./knowledge-processor');
const knowledgeStore = require('./knowledge-store');

// Message monitoring
client.on('messageCreate', async message => {
  // Skip bot messages and opt-out users
  if (message.author.bot || optOutUsers.includes(message.author.id)) return;
  
  // Process message content
  const processedContent = await knowledgeProcessor.processMessage(message);
  
  // If valuable knowledge detected
  if (processedContent.knowledgeValue > THRESHOLD) {
    // Store in knowledge base
    await knowledgeStore.addEntry(processedContent);
    
    // Optionally acknowledge valuable contributions
    if (processedContent.knowledgeValue > HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD) {
      await message.react('ðŸ’¡');
    }
  }
});

// Knowledge query commands
client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
  if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;
  
  if (interaction.commandName === 'knowledge') {
    const query = interaction.options.getString('query');
    const results = await knowledgeStore.search(query);
    
    // Format and send results
    const embed = new MessageEmbed()
      .setTitle(`Knowledge Base Results: ${query}`)
      .setDescription(formatResults(results));
      
    await interaction.reply({ embeds: [embed] });
  }
});
```

### 2. LLM Processing Pipeline

```python
import openai
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

class KnowledgeProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.1)
        self.memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
        self.chain = ConversationChain(llm=self.llm, memory=self.memory)
        
    def process_conversation(self, messages):
        """Process a group of related messages to extract knowledge"""
        # Prepare conversation context
        conversation = self._format_conversation(messages)
        
        # Extract key information
        extraction_prompt = f"""
        From the following conversation about Anarchy Inference programming language, 
        extract the key technical information, code examples, and explanations:
        
        {conversation}
        
        Format the extracted knowledge as:
        TOPIC: [main topic]
        CONCEPTS: [key concepts explained]
        CODE EXAMPLES: [any code shared]
        EXPLANATIONS: [explanations provided]
        QUESTIONS ANSWERED: [questions that were answered]
        OPEN QUESTIONS: [questions that remain unanswered]
        """
        
        extracted_knowledge = self.llm(extraction_prompt)
        
        # Validate and enhance extracted knowledge
        validated_knowledge = self._validate_knowledge(extracted_knowledge)
        
        # Format for storage
        structured_knowledge = self._structure_for_storage(validated_knowledge)
        
        return structured_knowledge
        
    def _format_conversation(self, messages):
        """Format raw messages into a readable conversation"""
        # Implementation details
        
    def _validate_knowledge(self, knowledge):
        """Validate extracted knowledge against known facts"""
        # Implementation details
        
    def _structure_for_storage(self, knowledge):
        """Convert to storage format with metadata"""
        # Implementation details
```

### 3. Knowledge Base Schema

```typescript
// Knowledge entity types
interface KnowledgeEntity {
  id: string;
  type: 'concept' | 'codeExample' | 'explanation' | 'qa' | 'tutorial';
  title: string;
  content: string;
  created: Date;
  updated: Date;
  contributors: string[]; // Discord user IDs
  sources: Source[];
  confidence: number; // 0-1 score of confidence in accuracy
  verified: boolean; // Whether manually verified by maintainer
  tags: string[];
  relatedEntities: string[]; // IDs of related entities
}

interface Source {
  type: 'discord' | 'github' | 'documentation';
  id: string; // Message ID, commit hash, etc.
  url: string; // Direct link to source
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Document structure
interface KnowledgeDocument {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  sections: DocumentSection[];
  created: Date;
  updated: Date;
  contributors: string[];
  category: string;
  subcategory: string;

}
```

## Knowledge Extraction Process

### 1. Conversation Monitoring
The system continuously monitors Discord channels for technical discussions, questions, and knowledge sharing.

### 2. Conversation Grouping
Related messages are grouped into conversation threads based on:
- Reply chains
- Message proximity in time
- Topic similarity
- Participant overlap

### 3. Knowledge Value Assessment
Each conversation is evaluated for knowledge value based on:
- Technical depth
- Uniqueness of information
- Clarity of explanations
- Presence of code examples
- Community engagement (reactions, replies)

### 4. LLM Processing
High-value conversations are processed by the LLM pipeline:
1. **Extraction**: Key information is extracted from the conversation
2. **Categorization**: Information is categorized by topic and type
3. **Structuring**: Information is converted to structured format
4. **Enhancement**: Additional context or explanations are added
5. **Validation**: Information is validated against known facts

### 5. Knowledge Storage
Processed knowledge is stored in the knowledge base:
- New entities are created for novel information
- Existing entities are updated with new details
- Relationships are established between entities
- Source attribution is maintained

### 6. Documentation Generation
The system periodically generates documentation from the knowledge base:
- Topic-based organization
- Progressive disclosure (basic to advanced)
- Code example inclusion
- Cross-referencing related topics

## User Interaction Flows

### 1. Knowledge Query
1. User asks a question in Discord using `/knowledge query`
2. System searches knowledge base for relevant information
3. Results are presented in Discord with links to full documentation
4. User can provide feedback on helpfulness

### 2. Automatic Suggestions
1. System monitors ongoing conversations
2. When a question is detected, system checks if answer exists in knowledge base
3. If relevant information exists, system suggests it with a brief preview
4. User can request more details or full documentation

### 3. Knowledge Gap Reporting
1. System identifies questions that couldn't be answered from knowledge base
2. These are logged as knowledge gaps
3. Community members can be prompted to fill these gaps
4. Project maintainers receive regular reports on common knowledge gaps

### 4. Documentation Browsing
1. User accesses web interface for knowledge base
2. Browses by category or searches for specific topics
3. Views structured documentation with code examples
4. Can provide feedback or suggest improvements
