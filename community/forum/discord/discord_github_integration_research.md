# Discord-GitHub Integration Research

## Overview
This document explores the integration options between Discord and GitHub for the Anarchy Inference community platform. The goal is to create a seamless experience where community members can engage in real-time discussions on Discord while maintaining connection to the GitHub repository for code-related activities.

## Integration Options

### 1. GitHub Bot for Discord

#### Description
The GitHub bot for Discord provides notifications about repository events directly to Discord channels.

#### Features
- Repository activity notifications (commits, pull requests, issues)
- Customizable notification filters
- Command-based interaction with GitHub from Discord
- Webhook support for custom event handling

#### Setup Process
1. Create a Discord server
2. Add the GitHub bot to the server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=84607697821209600&scope=bot&permissions=67584
3. Configure the bot with `/github subscribe owner/repository`
4. Customize notification settings with `/github configure owner/repository`

#### Pros
- Official GitHub integration
- Easy setup process
- Reliable notifications
- No self-hosting required

#### Cons
- Limited customization options
- No advanced features like code preview
- Cannot trigger GitHub actions from Discord

### 2. Discord Webhooks for GitHub

#### Description
GitHub webhooks can be configured to send repository events to Discord channels through Discord's webhook integration.

#### Features
- Customizable event notifications
- Detailed message formatting
- Support for all GitHub event types
- Repository-specific configurations

#### Setup Process
1. Create a webhook in Discord channel settings
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Add the webhook to GitHub repository settings
4. Configure the events to be sent to Discord

#### Pros
- Highly customizable
- No bot installation required
- Can be configured per repository

#### Cons
- One-way communication (GitHub to Discord only)
- Requires manual setup for each repository
- No interactive commands

### 3. Custom Discord Bot with GitHub API

#### Description
A custom Discord bot can be developed to provide advanced integration between Discord and GitHub, including interactive features and LLM-powered knowledge extraction.

#### Features
- Two-way integration between platforms
- Interactive commands for repository management
- Code snippet sharing and preview
- Issue and PR creation from Discord
- LLM-powered knowledge extraction from discussions
- Automated documentation generation

#### Setup Process
1. Develop a custom Discord bot using Discord.js or similar library
2. Implement GitHub API integration using Octokit or similar
3. Deploy the bot to a hosting service
4. Add the bot to the Discord server
5. Configure the bot with repository access tokens

#### Pros
- Full customization of features
- Advanced integration capabilities
- LLM integration for knowledge management
- Can implement project-specific workflows

#### Cons
- Requires development resources
- Needs ongoing maintenance
- Requires hosting infrastructure
- More complex setup

### 4. Third-Party Integration Services

#### Description
Several third-party services provide pre-built integrations between Discord and GitHub with additional features.

#### Options

**a. Zapier**
- Connects Discord and GitHub through automated workflows
- Supports various triggers and actions
- No coding required
- Subscription-based pricing

**b. IFTTT**
- Simple "if this, then that" automation
- Limited free tier available
- Easy setup process
- Less customizable than other options

**c. n8n**
- Open-source workflow automation
- Self-hostable
- Highly customizable
- Requires technical setup

#### Pros
- Pre-built integration templates
- Minimal development required
- Can connect multiple services beyond GitHub
- Often include analytics and monitoring

#### Cons
- Subscription costs for premium features
- Limited customization compared to custom solutions
- Potential privacy concerns with third-party services
- May introduce additional points of failure

## Recommended Approach

Based on the evaluation, a **hybrid approach** combining multiple integration methods is recommended:

1. **Start with GitHub Bot for Discord** for immediate basic integration
   - Quick setup to get repository notifications flowing into Discord
   - Provides essential GitHub activity updates to Discord channels

2. **Implement Discord Webhooks for GitHub** for customized notifications
   - Configure specific event types and formatting
   - Create dedicated channels for different notification types (issues, PRs, commits)

3. **Develop a Custom Discord Bot** for advanced features and LLM integration
   - Begin with basic functionality and expand over time
   - Implement LLM-powered knowledge extraction from discussions
   - Add interactive GitHub commands for community members
   - Create automated documentation generation from discussions

This phased approach allows for immediate integration while building toward the more advanced features that will make the community platform unique and valuable.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (1-2 days)
1. Create Discord server with appropriate channel structure
2. Add GitHub Bot to Discord server
3. Configure basic notifications for repository events
4. Set up Discord webhooks for customized notifications
5. Document the setup and share with the community

### Phase 2: Custom Bot Development (2-4 weeks)
1. Design bot architecture with GitHub API integration
2. Implement core functionality:
   - Repository information commands
   - Issue and PR management
   - Code snippet sharing
3. Deploy bot to hosting service
4. Add bot to Discord server and test functionality
5. Document bot commands and usage

### Phase 3: LLM Knowledge Integration (4-8 weeks)
1. Design knowledge extraction system architecture
2. Implement conversation monitoring and topic detection
3. Develop knowledge base storage and retrieval system
4. Create documentation generation pipeline
5. Implement search functionality for knowledge base
6. Test and refine the system
7. Document the knowledge base system for community use

## Next Steps
1. Create Discord server structure
2. Document channel organization and purpose
3. Implement Phase 1 integrations
4. Begin design work for custom bot
